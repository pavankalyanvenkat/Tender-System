# Tender-system
When a company seeks a service or merchandise, it initiates a tender process, exclusively open to empaneled vendors. Each vendor on the empaneled list is entitled to submit a bid for a tender, limited to one bid per vendor. Multiple vendors may participate in bidding for a single tender, but the company ultimately chooses the most fitting proposal and awards the order to the selected vendor.
